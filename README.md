# Sentiment_Analysis
# Plan of Action
# 1.Load IMDb Movie Review dataset(50000 reviews)
## "/content/drive/MyDrive/a1_IMDB_Dataset.csv"
# 2.Preprocess dataset by removing special characters numbers etc from user
# review+convert sentiment labels positive negative to number 0 &1 respectively
# 3.Import Glove Word Embedding (glove.6B.100d.txt) to build Embedding Dictionary +use this to build 
# Embedding matrix to your  corpus
# 4.Model Training using Deep Learning in Keras for separate simple Neural Net,CNN and
# LSTM
# 5.Last perform prediction on real IMDb movie reviews

 We got the best results from LSTM model with an accuracy of 86% 
other models showed accuracy of 85% for CNN (Convolutional Neural Network ) and 75 % for Feedforward Neural Network .
After that Performed Model Performance on Unseen IMDB dataset preprocessed the unseen data set and we got the accuracy pretty close to actual IMDB rating .
